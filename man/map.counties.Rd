data(map.counties)
}
\description{
A data.frame which contains a map of all 50 US States plus
the District of Columbia.  The shapefile
was modified using QGIS in order to 1) remove
Puerto Rico 2) remove islands off of Alaska that
crossed the antimeridian 3) renamed the county "Dona Ana" (which is properly written with a tilde over the
first "n") to "Dona Ana" because R CMD check emits a warning if data contains non-ASCII characters 4) some columns were added for convenience.

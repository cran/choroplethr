\usage{
data(map.world)
}
\description{
This data.frame corresponds to version 2.0.0 of the "Admin 0 - Countries" map from naturalearthdata.com
The data.frame was modified by removing columns with non-ASCII characters. Also,
I added a column called "region" which is the the all lowercase version of the
column "sovereignt".
}
\details{
Note that due to the resolution of the map (1:110m, or 1 cm=1,100 km), small countries are not
represented on this map.  See ?country.names for a list of all countries represented on the map.
